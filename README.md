To check that you have .NET v4 installed on your Window 10 PC, run from command prompt:

reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4"

It must return a entry which ends with "Full", e.g. 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full

If not there, then you need to download .NET 4.5 from Microsoft directly:
